## 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos

Passionate about **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on **Reinforcement Learning**.

This GitHub is where I share my learning journey and personal projects — from implementing core algorithms like classification models and linear regression from scratch, to training agents to play **Super Mario Bros** using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.

All my work is **Open Source**. Feel free to explore, learn, or contribute.
