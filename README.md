## 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos

Passionate about **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on **Reinforcement Learning**.

This GitHub is where I share my learning journey and personal projects — from implementing core algorithms like classification models and linear regression from scratch, to training agents to play **Super Mario Bros** using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.

All my work is **Open Source**. Feel free to explore, learn, or contribute.

## 🧠 What I'm working on

- 🎮 Training agents to play classic games using **Reinforcement Learning** with **Computer Vision** inputs (PPO, CNN policies, frame stacking, etc.)
- ✈️ Teaching drones autonomous navigation with vision-based inputs using **AirSim** and **RL**
- 📊 I'm also studying advanced topics in **Deep Learning**, **Maths for ML**, and **Reinforcement Learning**
