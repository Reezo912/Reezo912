## 👋 Hi, I'm Reezo

I'm an enthusiastic learner deeply focused on **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, with a strong passion for **Reinforcement Learning**.

This GitHub is where I share my learning journey and personal projects — from implementing core algorithms like Classification models and linear regression from scratch, to training agents to play **Super Mario Bros** using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.

All my work is **Open Source**. Feel free to explore, learn, or contribute.
